# Zerfall
A game that [I'm](https://github.com/officialexosoft) developing using [Processing](http://processing.org).
Zerfall was originally planned to be developed in [QB64](http://qb64.net), but this was changed due to limitations. The current development stage is improving the functionality of [Zerfall.pde](https://github.com/Zerfall/Zerfall.pde), and the other embedded sketches. Any and all contributions are welcome, please contact me at officialexosoft@gmail.com if you have any questions.
