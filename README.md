# Zerfall
A game I'm developing using Processing.
Zerfall was originally planned to be developed in QB64, but this was changed to Processing. The current development stage
is getting `Zerfall.pde` to the same functionality as `bunker new.bas`. Any and all contributions are welcome, please contact me if you have any questions.
