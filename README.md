# Zerfall, hello
A game that we at Exoplanet Software are developing using [the Processing IDE](http://processing.org).
Zerfall was originally planned to be developed in [QB64](http://qb64.net), but this was changed due to limitations. The current development stage is improving the functionality of [Zerfall.pde](https://github.com/Zerfall/Zerfall.pde), and the other embedded sketches.
Zerfall is a two-dimensional wave-based zombie survival platformer inspired by Treyarch's Call of Duty Zombies gamemode. This game is open source.
